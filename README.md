# ClassSync 
*A Real-Time Engagement Monitoring Web App for Remote K-12 Classrooms*

Goal: To provide educators an easy-to-use browser-based tool for tracking actionable data on studentsâ€™ activity during live remote classroom sessions.

This was a group capstone project at Fullstack Academy in NYC!

Creators: Alex Bangiyev, Barish Poole, Charles Pan, Joel McGill

Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg7UTfmFRIo

Latest Production Link: https://classsync.herokuapp.com

Default teacher login to try out live sessions and examine past data: 
- kylalara1@gmail.com, password: 123

Student logins:  
- pierreparkes1@gmail.com, pw 123
- omarmartin1@gmail.com, pw 123
- mindycain1@gmail.com, pw 123

You can simulate a session locally by logging in as the teacher in one tab and a student in another incognito window. Or hold fully remote sessions with multiple students logged in on separate machines.

At this time the app is optimized for and most functional on Google Chrome. We plan to continue testing and expand compatibility to all major browsers as we build out this project.
